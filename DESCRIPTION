Description: The `MultiEWCE` R package allows you to run 
  [Expression Weighted Celltype Enrichment 
  (EWCE)](https://github.com/NathanSkene/EWCE) 
  on multiple gene lists in parallel. It was primarily designed for use with
  the [Human Phenotype Ontology](https://hpo.jax.org/), 
  but can be easily adapted to any other gene lists. Finally, it includes 
  pipelines for the systematic identification of cell type-specific gene therapy
  targets of diseases.
